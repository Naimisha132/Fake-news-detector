##  Technologies Used

-  Python
-  Pandas & Regex (text cleaning)
-  TF-IDF Vectorizer (feature extraction)
-  Logistic Regression (classification)
-  Scikit-learn (metrics, model building)
-  NLP basics (lowercasing, symbol removal)

## Workflow Summary

1. Load and merge datasets
2. Clean text using regex and lowercasing
3. Vectorize using TF-IDF
4. Split into training and testing sets
5. Train a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluate with accuracy and classification report
